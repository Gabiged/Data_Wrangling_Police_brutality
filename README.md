# Data_Wrangling_Police_brutality
This analysis is made based on Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S. '15 - '17.
The objective is to to see if the number of victims is influenced by race, 
high unemployment rates and low hourly wages, which would indicate an increased criminogenic situation in the state.<br>
Additional datasets used:<br>
2020 year racial diversity census from United States Census Bureau: https://www.census.gov/ <br>
(the dataset used to determine population proportions)<br>
Dataset for unemployment rates by state: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayrav13/unemployment-by-county-us <br>
Minimum wage dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017 <br>
Conclusions: <br>
The Black Lives Matter movement in the US, which started in 2013, has led to a lot of outrage and additional questions about the use of police force. <br>
The purpose of the analysis was to find out whether brutality is really directed specifically at non-whites, and what might have caused such actions to occur. <br>
* The data show that, although the highest number of victims is among the white population, the proportion of the population reveals quite different figures: <br>
the highest proportions of victims are among the black and Hispanic population.<br>
* The next question is what might influence the number of incidents in the 20-40 year old male population. The most common hypothesis is that high unemployment <br>
and low wages increase the criminogenic situation. However, these hypotheses have not been confirmed, or have been partially confirmed: the unemployment rate and <br>
low hourly wages do not have an impact, but on the contrary, the state (California) which has the highest number of recorded fatal incidents offers one of <br>
the highest hourly wages. I believe that this factor is the biggest population pull factor in the number of incidents.<br>
* Another interesting fact: most deaths occur when the victim is armed with a firearm, as well as with other dangerous weapons, so that the officer's reaction <br>
can be justified as complacent. The large number of incidents (266) where the victim was unarmed and the weapon was not identified makes it necessary to look into <br> 
the situation, and these incidents are grounds for indignation against police brutality. <br>
* The use of newer technologies (such as video cameras) shows a marked reduction in fatal incidents. This type of control is probably the most effective way of <br>
dealing with the legality of excessive use of force.
